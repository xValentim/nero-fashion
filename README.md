**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.  The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

Google uses this application to demonstrate how developers can modernize enterprise applications using Google Cloud products, including: [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Cloud Service Mesh (CSM)](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [Cloud Operations](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations), [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), [Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore), [AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb), and [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/). This application works on any Kubernetes cluster.

**Note to Googlers:** Please fill out the form at [go/microservices-demo](http://go/microservices-demo).

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 12 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. This includes an AI-powered fashion assistant service (nanobananaservice) that uses Google's Gemini AI for intelligent product recommendations and image analysis.
